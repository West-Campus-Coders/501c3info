## Tasks:
- [x] make a small, functional API 
- [ ] dockerize the API 
- [ ] have the backend work with a mySQL server
- [x] create a backend class that can parse the index CSV file
- [ ] allow the backend to find the correct XML file

## Running the frontend

clone this repository

```sh 
git clone git@github.com:West-Campus-Coders/501c3info.git
```

OR 

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/West-Campus-Coders/501c3info.git
```

install npm packages (make sure you're in the frontend directory)

```sh 
npm i 
```

run the website

```sh 
npm run dev
```

## Running the backend API

PREREQUISITES: make sure you have flask installed
```sh 
pip install Flask
```

run the backend flask server

## Using the website

Once you have both frontend and backend running (on the same machine), you can use the <code>localhost</code> as the IP address as the input for the frontend.
